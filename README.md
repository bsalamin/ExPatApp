# ExPatApp
## Overview
This app allows potential expatriots (expats) to discover possible countries and/or cities they might want to move to should they decide to leave the US. The user chooses their individual preferences from a specified list of parameters (political, economic, etc.) and the app results showcase different cities/countries to move to based on the input selections.

## Communication Protocols
- GitHub: contains final documents and code relevant to the app
- Google Drive: sandbox testing site for all gathered data, code, etc.
- ETL: used for API and webscraping
- Postgres: holds datasets and SQL queries

## Dashborad
We will either be creating some sort of app that would allow for the input of everything. We may also be creating a dashboard that has sliding scales that would allow for input. This would help to properly weight the different facotrs according to the users desires. A map would also be incorportaed with a heat map to show how countries are weighted.
