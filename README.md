# ExPat App

## Problem
With changing political and economic landscapes and different travel patterns in a post-COVID world, there is new interest for emigration from America. However, there is no clear index of how an American should go about choosing a different country to start a new life.

## Overview
This app will perform an analysis to help potential expatriots (expats) discover new places they might want to immigrate to, should they decide to leave the USA. The user chooses their individual preferences from a specified list of parameters (political, economic, etc.) and the app results showcase different countries to move to based on the input selections.

## Communication and Technology Protocols
- GitHub: contains final documents and code relevant to the app
- Google Drive: sandbox testing site for all gathered data, code, etc. including Google Colab
- Postgres: holds datasets and SQL queries
- Python libraries: Pandas, scikit-learn, etc.
- *Tableau: data visualization*

## Data Sources
The data for this analysis will be sourced from government agencies, international organizations (e.g., the UN and OECD), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as private sources that may have relevant data for traveling, culture, and economics (Yelp, Google, etcetera). A [preliminary data flow chart diagram](https://github.com/nicolebplatt/ExPatApp/blob/main/Data%20Flow%20Chart.pdf) is also available:

The data for this project is grouped into the following key metrics that would be important for Americans considering emigrating:
* [Economy: Human Development Index](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads)
* [Health: Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE)](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/)
* [Political: Democracy Index](https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2020/)
* [Education: Literacy Rates](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads)
* [Culture and Lifestyle: Freedom of Religion](https://govdata360.worldbank.org/indicators/hd6a18526?indicator=41930&viz=line_chart&years=1975,2020#table-link)

## Methodology
- Insert some info about Jackie's database and Tom's ML code
- We need to decide if we're going to include user input or just similar countries

## Summary
From analyzing the data, this project intends to answer the question of which countries are most suitable for emigration from America.
- Insert info and screenshots from ML output

## Results
- Include clusters similar to US and/or outcome from user input
